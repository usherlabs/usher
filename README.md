## 👋 Introduction

Usher is an Open Source Partnerships Platform that enables Brands to grow through performance-based marketing.

Start a Partner, Affiliate, Ambassador, or Reseller Program by deploying Usher, or engaging a [public managed Usher Core Node](https://app.usher.so/?ref=github).

<img alt="Partner Portal 3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usherlabs/usher/master/images/docs/partner-portal-3.jpeg" width="720px">

### For Brands

1. Create a Partnership Campaign that defines conversion events and their associated incentives.
   These events are triggered within your Web App, infrastructure, and even [Smart Contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp).
2. Fund the Campaign to ensure partners are aware of available funds and therefore remaining incentives.
3. When a conversion event is triggered off the back of a referral, the referrer _(aka. Partner)_ accrues rewards accordingly.

#### Note on Decentralisation

Usher is being designed to interoperate with decentralised systems to yield the fairest outcomes for all participants.
Nonetheless, the user experience will remain familiar and inspired by traditional web applications we know and love - as to minimise user complexity.
The goal is to ensure **any Brand can leverage Usher** whether they're a [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) Protocol, an [eCommerce](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/what-is-ecommerce) store, or even a Content Creator!

### For Partners

_Partners can be affiliates, ambassadors, influencers, publishers, etc._

1. Learn and understand a Campaign to know if it's suitable for your audience, community, or clients.
2. Engage the Campaign and get a shareable invite link.
3. Share your link to refer people to the Brand's service.
4. Earn rewards when referred people trigger conversion events within the Brand's service.
5. Claim your rewards

### For Operators

_An Operator is an entity or individual responsible for deploying and managing an Usher instance._
_This can be the Brand looking to offer a white-labelled partner/affiliate experience, or a third party, such as a Marketing Agency, Marketplace, or [DAO](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/), seeking to elevate its community into evangelists._

1. Deploy the Usher Stack.
2. Invite your community to your Usher instance to seed the partner network.
3. _(Optionally)_ Yield a commission when partners claim their rewards.

#### Note on Rewards

Rewards are handled using cryptocurrency, ensuring accessibility for participants across the world.
Currently, the Operator is responsible for storing **encrypted** Wallet Private Keys within their Database.
Each Campaign has a corresponding wallet that is funded by the Brand responsible for the Campaign.
_Decentralisation of funds management coming soon..._

These rewards can be:

1. ERC20 tokens such as [USDC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin), or [ETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum)
2. ERC721 or ERC1155 NFTs
3. There's also logic to support [AR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arweave) tokens

## 🌟 Features

Usher Core encompasses the necessary code to run:

- An application to deliver a user-friendly front-end interface, and server-side operations
- Database migrations to ensure smooth deployment and updates
- Command-line tools for administrative support
- A Listener service that facilitates conversions based on Smart Contract events.

## 📐 Core architecture

![Usher core architecture](images/docs/CoreArchitecture.png)

- **Core Web App**: Usher Core's central component is a **[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)**-based Application that provides an accessible and user-friendly interface for managing campaigns. It also ensures smooth interaction with other services by employing deployed serverless functions.
- **User-owned Database**: By leveraging **[Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/)**'s decentralized data storage network, Usher Core provides a secure and user-centric data management solution. Ceramic schemas ensure organized and consistent data storage for elements like partnerships, campaign details, and advertiser profiles while allowing users to maintain control over their data.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Employs **[Humanode](https://humanode.io/)**'s [Sybil Resistance](https://blog.humanode.io/attack-on-sybil/) and OAuth systems to maintain the integrity of user interactions within the platform, ensuring that only genuine users can participate in the ecosystem and preserving the security and trustworthiness of user accounts.
- **Graph Database**: Centralized storage using **[ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com/)**, a multi-mode graph database. It holds data about user interactions, partnerships, campaigns, and more.
- _(Optional)_ **Listener Service**: An service for listening to an EVM Blockchain and creating conversions off the back of Smart Contract events.
  - Where a Campaign is configured to include events that reference Smart Contracts, the Shareable Invite Links will request a Wallet Connection from referred users to capture their wallets and attribute them to a Partner's referrals

## 🏁 Getting started

1. Ensure your system meets the requirements:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Yarn (v1)
- docker-compose (v1.25.5 or higher)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usherlabs/usher.git
cd usher
```

2. To install dependencies, run `pnpm install` in the root directory.

   > Usher Core is a monorepo with multiple packages in the `packages` directory. Each package has its own `package.json` and scripts. Learn more about [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

3. For package overviews and instructions to start services, refer to the respective package documentation.

## **🚀** Usage and Deployment

Users can interact with your deployed Usher Core node in two ways:

- By using the frontend interface deployed by the same node
- By integrating directly with your servers, utilizing [User Programs](https://github.com/usherlabs/programs)

Deploying each of the packages requires a review of information in each of their README files.

### Setting up our Core Next.js application

[This guide provided at `packages/app`](./packages/app/README.md#how-to-run-it) will help you set up the Next.js application for Usher Core.

By following it, you will be able to:

- Run the Next.js application locally
- Deploy this application to Vercel

### Setting up ArangoDB

[This guide provided at `packages/graph`](./packages/graph/README.md#setting-up-an-arangodb-instance) will help you set up ArangoDB for Usher Core.

By following it, you will be able to:

- Set up an ArangoDB instance on ArangoDB Cloud or on-premise, even at your local machine
- Set up a database and a database user for Usher Core usage

### Setting up migrations with ArangoMiGO

[This guide provided at `packages/graph`](./packages/graph/README.md#using-arangomigo-to-manage-migrations) will help you set up ArangoMiGO to manage migrations on your ArangoDB instance.

By following it, you will be able to:

- Install Golang and necessary dependencies to run ArangoMiGO
- Install ArangoMiGO
- Run the migration files to create and update the database structure required by Usher Core

### Setting up the Listener Node _(Optional)_

[This guide provided at `packages/listener`](./packages/listener/README.md#deploy) will help you set up the Listener Node for Usher Core.

It will help you to either:

- Use the Listener Node locally
- Deploy the Listener Node using docker
- Manually deploy the Listener Node to a VPS (e.g. Ubuntu)

You may want to deploy the Listener Node if you want to track conversions on blockchain ecosystems or other smart contracts.

### Setting up a Ceramic Node _(Optional)_

By default, you can use Usher's Public Ceramic Node for Production purposes - **hosted at [https://ceramic.usher.so](https://ceramic.usher.so)**.

If you prefer to manage your own Cermaic Node for administative purposes, [the guide outlined in `packages/ceramic`](./packages/ceramic/README.md#ceramic) will help you set up a Ceramic node for Usher Core.

### During these steps you may find it helpful to:

- **[Create a Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)** to support the deployment of the `app` package.
- **[Set up ArangoDB Cloud or On-Premise](https://www.arangodb.com/)** to handle Usher's data. Refer to the `graph`
  package to learn more.
- **[Create a Sentry account](https://sentry.io/signup/)** to enable error tracking and monitoring for your Usher Core
  deployment. This will help you identify and resolve issues more efficiently, ensuring a smoother user experience.

But bear in mind that these are not mandatory steps. You may choose to deploy Usher Core using other preferred services as well.
